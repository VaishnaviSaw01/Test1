Problem Statement 8:

Actual Output:
Hello
ReferenceError: Cannot access 'sayHi' before initialization

Explanation:

1. sayHello() - WORKS (outputs "Hello")
   Function declarations are hoisted to the top
   sayHello can be called before it's declared

2. sayHi() - THROWS ERROR
   sayHi is a function expression assigned to a variable
   Variables declared with 'var' are hoisted but NOT initialized
   At the time sayHi() is called, the variable exists but is undefined
   Calling undefined as a function causes: TypeError (not ReferenceError)

CORRECTED CODE - 

sayHello();
function sayHello() {
    console.log("Hello");
}

var sayHi = function () {
    console.log("Hi");
};

sayHi();  

OUTPUT:
Hello
Hi
