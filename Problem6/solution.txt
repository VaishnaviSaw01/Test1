Problem Statement 6

Consider the following code:
console.log(a);   //undefined (hoisting)
console.log(b);   //ReferenceError: Cannot access 'b' before initialization
var a = 10;       //Not executed due to error
let b = 20;
function test() {
  console.log(c);  //undefined (hoisting inside function)
  var c = 30;
}
test(); //Not reached

EXPLANATION:
*Why 'a' prints undefined:
  var declarations are hoisted to top with undefined value
  a is declared but not yet assigned when console.log(a) runs

*Why 'b' throws an error:
  let/const are hoisted but not initialized (Temporal Dead Zone)
  Accessing b before initialization throws ReferenceError

*Why 'c' is undefined inside function:
  var c is hoisted to top of function scope with undefined
  console.log(c) runs before c = 30 assignment

CORRECTED CODE:

var a = 10;
let b = 20;

console.log(a);    // 10
console.log(b);    // 20

function test() {
    var c = 30;
    console.log(c);  // 30
}

test();
